This
repo
is
an
implementation
of
the
paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05922v1.pdf
in
which
a
new
algorithm
for
grayscale
histogram
equalization
to
improve
image
contrast.

I
have
found
that
in
some
instances
the
performance
is,
visually,
better
than
that
of
OpenCV's
histogram
equalization.
However,
the
result
I
get
for
the
camera
man
imagee,
includes
in _
examples_
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
paper
shows.
This
may
be
an
issue
with
my
implementation
of
the
paper
of
course.

The
requirement
is
just
numpy
in
order
to
use
the
algorithm
contained
in _
Improved_Equalization.py_
,
but
the
notebook
which
illustrates
the
algorithm
details
requires
openCV
as
well.

Feel
free
to
make
an
issue,
PR,
or
send
me
a
mail
if
you
have
any
questions.
